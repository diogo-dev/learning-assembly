# This repository is dedicated to store some of my assembly code developed during the classes of this language

-  The final project is located inside the folder called "./trabalho"
-  You can ignore the other folders as it contain the basics of the language.

The final project aims to develop a CRUD system for inventory control of a supermarket. This system will be responsible for performing basic operations on the products available in this supermarket. The operations implemented in this work are as follows:

- Product insertion
- Product removal
- Product update
- Product query
- Financial query
- Record saving to external .txt file
- Record retrieval from external .txt file

# How the application works?
When the executable file is running, the terminal will display a menu of options to the user, as shown in the image below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Screenshot_1.png" alt="User menu options" width="400" />
</p>

As you can see, the user actions are pretty simple. He/she needs to insert the number that corresponds to the chosen option. 

To a more specific explanation, I suggest you to read the documentation (./relatorioAssembly.pdf, ./relatorioAssembly2.pdf).

In addition, the code is strongly commented which makes it easy to understand its functionality.
